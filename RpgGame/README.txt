Most of the source code in this project comes from a tutorial made by Scott Lilly. A link to
the project is https://github.com/ScottLilly/SuperAdventure.

I took the opportunity to recreate this project for my own learning purpose on the basic but
key fundemental aspects of C# and object-oriented programming.
